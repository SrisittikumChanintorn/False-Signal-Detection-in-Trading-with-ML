# 📌 Machine Learning for False Signal Detection in Trading

## 📖 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** to **False Signal Detection** in trading. The goal is to enhance the **win rate** of a trading system by identifying **ineffective trade signals**. By leveraging **supervised learning** with models such as:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naïve Bayes**

The system learns from **historical trading signals**, **technical indicators**, and their **trade outcomes (profit/loss)** to detect unreliable signals that frequently lead to losses.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Train ML models to **recognize losing trade patterns**.
- **Filter out false signals** before executing trades.
- Improve overall **trading performance and risk management**.

---

## 📊 Dataset & Features
The dataset consists of **historical data**,**technical indicators**,**input features**,**trading signals** and **trade outcomes ( target variable )**.

### 🔹 Over All:

- **Historical Data:** Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV).
- **Technical Indicators:** Moving Averages for creating  Trading Signals
- **Trading Signals:** Buy/Sell signals generated by the system.

### **🧩 Input Features:**

-  **Compare the distance between the entry point and the short-term Moving Average at the entry points** ( Expressed as a percentage change )  

-  **Compare the distance between the entry point and the long-term Moving Average at the entry points** ( Expressed as a percentage change )  

-  **Compare the distance between the exit point and the short-term Moving Average at the exit point** ( Expressed as a percentage change )  

-  **Compare the distance between the exit point and the long-term Moving Average at the exit point** ( Expressed as a percentage change )

-  **Compare the distance between the exit point and the short-term Moving Average at the entry point** ( Expressed as a percentage change)

-  **Compare the distance between the exit point and the long-term Moving Average at the entry point** ( Expressed as a percentage change)
  
     
### **🎯 Target Variable:**
- **Profit/Loss Classification:** Binary output (Win ✅ or Loss ❌)

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models
Three supervised learning models are implemented:

### **🌳 Decision Tree**
- A tree-based model that learns decision rules from historical trades.
- Captures non-linear relationships and interpretable decision paths.

### **🌲 Random Forest**
- An ensemble of Decision Trees to reduce overfitting.
- Improves accuracy and generalization.

### **🧮 Naïve Bayes**
- Probabilistic classifier.
- Based on Conditional Probability.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Fetching Data:** Gather market data trading signals, technical indicators, and trade results.**
   - Fetch Historical Data.
   - Calculate Exponentail Moving Average. ( Trading Indicator )
   - Create Trading Signals.
2. **Backtest Trading Strategy:**
   - Backtest Trading signals performance with vectorbt.
   - Observe trading journals to evaluate trading performance.
     
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Incorporate trading journal (Trading History)
   - Create Specific Indicators for Machine Learning Models
   - Use the Specific Indicators with trading signals at each time period along with the trade outcomes (Profit or Loss) to construct a new table for Feature Engineering before training Machine Learning models.

5. **Data Manipulation & Pre-Processing ( for Machine Learning Models ):**
   - Split data into training & testing sets as a time series method.
   - Use the DecisionTree model to identify parameters that yield the highest Precision and F1 Score, respectively. These parameters are used to improve trading quality by using machine learning to filter profit/loss buy points and the corresponding sell points, based on historical data (excluding unseen data).

6. **Model Creation:**
   - Train DecisionTree, RandomForest, and NaïveBayes models with training set.
   - Assume that every model can detect profit and loss, and is ready to predict on unseen data.
     
7. **Fowardtest with unseen data ( test set ) :**
   - Backtest the technical analysis indicators using the same period of unseen data.
   - Make predictions using machine learning models on unseen data (test set).
   - Develop rules to filter out unreliable trade signals from machine learning models.
     
9. **Trading Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trading performance on unseen data using technical indicators, decision tree, random forest, and naive bayes, and compare the results with the buy & hold strategy and benchmark.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of correctly identified winning trades.
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes classification performance.

## 📌 Expected Outcome
✅ **Reduced False Trades:** Fewer trades based on unreliable signals.  
✅ **Improved Trading Win Rate:** More profitable trades and reduced unnecessary losses.  
✅ **Better Risk Management:** Avoiding bad trades reduces exposure to losses.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Experiment with technical indicators, fundamental data, economic data, and other news data as well.
🔹 Incorporate **Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN)** for pattern recognition.  
🔹 Implement **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for strategy optimization.  
🔹 Experiment with additional **Feature Selection Techniques**.
