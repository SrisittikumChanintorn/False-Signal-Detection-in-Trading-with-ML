# 📌 Machine Learning for False Signal Detection in Trading

## 📖 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** to **False Signal Detection** in trading. The goal is to enhance the **win rate** of a trading system by identifying **ineffective trade signals**. By leveraging **supervised learning** with models such as:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naïve Bayes**

The system learns from **historical trading signals**, **technical indicators**, and their **trade outcomes (profit/loss)** to detect unreliable signals that frequently lead to losses.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Train ML models to **recognize losing trade patterns**.
- **Filter out false signals** before executing trades.
- Improve overall **trading performance and risk management**.

---

## 📊 Dataset & Features
The dataset consists of **historical trading signals**, **technical indicators**, and **trade outcomes**.

### **🔹 Input Features:**
- **Trading Signals:** Buy/Sell signals generated by the system.
- **Technical Indicators:** Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- **Market Data:** Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV).
- **Other Derived Indicators:** Volatility, Momentum, Trend Strength, etc.

### **🎯 Target Variable:**
- **Profit/Loss Classification:** Binary output (Win ✅ or Loss ❌)

---

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models
Three supervised learning models are implemented:

### **🌳 Decision Tree**
- A tree-based model that learns decision rules from historical trades.
- Captures non-linear relationships and interpretable decision paths.

### **🌲 Random Forest**
- An ensemble of Decision Trees to reduce overfitting.
- Improves accuracy and generalization.

### **🧮 Naïve Bayes**
- Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem.
- Assumes feature independence and is effective for quick decision-making.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize or standardize features if necessary.
   - Label encode target variable.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new indicators or combine existing ones.
   - Identify the most important predictive features.
4. **Model Training & Validation:**
   - Split data into training & testing sets.
   - Train DecisionTree, RandomForest, and NaïveBayes models.
   - Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **False Signal Identification:**
   - Detect patterns in losing trades.
   - Develop rules to filter out unreliable trade signals.
6. **Deployment & Integration:**
   - Deploy the model for real-time false signal detection.
   - Integrate with an automated trading system.

## 📌 Expected Outcome
✅ **Reduced False Trades:** Fewer trades based on unreliable signals.  
✅ **Improved Trading Win Rate:** More profitable trades and reduced unnecessary losses.  
✅ **Better Risk Management:** Avoiding bad trades reduces exposure to losses.
