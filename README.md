# 📌 Machine Learning for False Signal Detection in Trading

## 📖 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** to **False Signal Detection** in trading. The goal is to enhance the **win rate** of a trading system by identifying **ineffective trade signals**. By leveraging **supervised learning** with models such as:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naïve Bayes**

The system learns from **historical trading signals**, **technical indicators**, and their **trade outcomes (profit/loss)** to detect unreliable signals that frequently lead to losses.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Train ML models to **recognize losing trade patterns**.
- **Filter out false signals** before executing trades.
- Improve overall **trading performance and risk management**.

---

## 📊 Dataset & Features
The dataset consists of **historical data**,**technical indicators**,**trading signals** and **trade outcomes**.

### **🔹 Input Features:**
- **Technical Indicators:** Moving Averages for creating  Trading Signals
- **Trading Signals:** Buy/Sell signals generated by the system.
- **Historical Data:** Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV).

### **🎯 Target Variable:**
- **Profit/Loss Classification:** Binary output (Win ✅ or Loss ❌)

---

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models
Three supervised learning models are implemented:

### **🌳 Decision Tree**
- A tree-based model that learns decision rules from historical trades.
- Captures non-linear relationships and interpretable decision paths.

### **🌲 Random Forest**
- An ensemble of Decision Trees to reduce overfitting.
- Improves accuracy and generalization.

### **🧮 Naïve Bayes**
- Probabilistic classifier.
- Based on Conditional Probability.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Gather market data trading signals, technical indicators, and trade results.**
   - Fetch Historical Data.
   - Calculate Exponentail Moving Average. ( Trading Indicator )
   - Create Trading Signals.
2. **Backtesting:**
   - Backtest Trading signals performance with vectorbt.
   - Observe trading journals to evaluate trading performance. 
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Normalization features with Z-Score.
   - Split data into training & testing sets as a time series method.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Use trading signals at each time period along with the trade outcomes (profit or loss) to construct a new table for feature engineering before training machine learning models.
   - Use the DecisionTree model to identify parameters that yield the highest Precision and F1 Score, respectively. These parameters are used to improve trading quality by using machine learning to filter profit/loss buy points and the corresponding sell points, based on historical data (excluding unseen data).
4. **Model Training:**
   - Train DecisionTree, RandomForest, and NaïveBayes models with training set.
   - Assume that every model can detect profit and loss.
5. **Fowardtest with unseen data ( test set ) :**
   - Forward-test technical indicators using signals generated from unseen data, including both the new technical indicators and the original signals from technical analysis.
   - Develop rules to filter out unreliable trade signals.
6. **Trading Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trading performance on unseen data using technical indicators, decision tree, random forest, and naive bayes, and compare the results with the buy & hold strategy and benchmark.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of correctly identified winning trades.
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes classification performance.

## 📌 Expected Outcome
✅ **Reduced False Trades:** Fewer trades based on unreliable signals.  
✅ **Improved Trading Win Rate:** More profitable trades and reduced unnecessary losses.  
✅ **Better Risk Management:** Avoiding bad trades reduces exposure to losses.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Experiment with technical indicators, fundamental data, economic data, and other news data as well.
🔹 Incorporate **Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN)** for pattern recognition.  
🔹 Implement **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for strategy optimization.  
🔹 Experiment with additional **Feature Selection Techniques**.
